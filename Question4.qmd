## Question 4: Linear Regression for cars data

Check that the beta coefficients we obtained from the b_hat matrix is the same when fitting the linear regression model using lm() in R.

```{r} # Fit the linear regression model using lm()}
lm_model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)    

# Get the coefficients from the lm model 
lm_coefficients <- coefficients(lm_model)  
lm_coefficients  

#compare logically b_hat vs estimates from lm() function  
```
