## Question 4: Linear Regression for cars data

```{r}
#Check that the beta coefficients we obtained from the b_hat matrix is the same when fitting the linear regression model using lm() in R.

# Fit the linear regression model using lm()} 
lm_model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
```

# Get the coefficients from the lm model

```{r}
lm_coefficients <- coefficients(lm_model)
lm_coefficients
summary(lm_model)

```
