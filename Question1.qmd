## Question 1: Missing Values

1st 6 rows of airquality dataset displayed below:

```{r}
head(airquality)

```

Display rows with missing values:

```{r}

# Find rows with missing values  
missing_values <- airquality[!complete.cases(airquality), ]  
missing_values
```

## Question 4: Linear Regression for cars data

Check that the beta coefficients we obtained from the b_hat matrix is the same when fitting the linear regression model using lm() in R.

```{r}
# Fit the linear regression model using lm()  
lm_model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)  

# Get the coefficients from the lm model  
lm_coefficients <- coefficients(lm_model) 
lm_coefficients

#compare logically b_hat vs estimates from lm() function 

```
